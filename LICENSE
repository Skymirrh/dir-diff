Well hello there, fellow human!

You can do whatever you want as long as you mention the original author (that's
me, yay!) somewhere, along with a link to where you found that. Perhaps a good
place for this acknowledgement would be in your own licencing notice.

There's no obligation to drop me a note if you use my stuff in your own work or
redistribute it, but I'd certainly appreciate the attention and check out what
you did with it. And if you end up rich using this, then I invite you to share a
bit of love, because why not? ;)

Obviously I expect you to be a sensible human being, capable of facing his own
responsibilities (isn't that great?). If you break something you're on your own,
I don't provide any warranty for anything.

Of course you can always send me a bug report, there's just no guarantee I'll
do anything about it (except in the odd case you got rich and decided to hire me
to do exactly that).

So yea, basically just don't be a dick and that'll fine by me.
Have a nice day :)
